# Under the hood #
HNC is an open-source cross-platform compiler based on modern technologies: Glasgow Haskell Platform, UUAGC attribute grammar preprocessor, Parsec parsing library, HOOPL graph optimization library.
The codebase is tiny: less than 4 KLOC, in the spirit of VPRI Ometa.
# State of affairs #
Many HN programs can already be compiled into an ugly functional subset of C++ and then into executables and run (see hn\_tests folder for .hn sources and .cpp targets). A UDP echo server and a few Project Euler problems are the only useful programs so far, but mostly because we are too lazy to write more examples.
# What is done #
  * Parser;
  * Type inference using UUAG, including injection of explicit template parameters when C++ doesn’t infer them;
  * Identifier- and scope-preserving translation from AST into graph IR and back using HOOPL dominator analysis;
  * A rudimentary and buggy optimizer of the IR using HOOPL;
  * Compiler of closures into C++ functors using UUAG (almost);
  * C++ pretty printer (almost);
  * A Boost.Build plugin to integrate .hn files into C++ projects.
# What is not done #
  * Proper error reporting;
  * Loops and assignments;
  * The inliner is buggy for HOFs;
  * The instantiator of polymorphic code into monomorphic is not implemented;
  * Module system, namespace support, HNI implementation and C++ integration in general are rudimentary or missing;
  * Priorities of C++ infix operators are broken;
  * RAII should be used with care;
  * Our Boost-based implementation of a generalization of std::bind1st only works under MSVC;
  * SPL support is almost missing;
  * Polymorphic constants like “empty list” are not supported.
# The bottom line #
We are begging you to help. Please come and motivate us to work on! Or, even better, donate us a few grand, so we can hire a third-world code monkey! (Of course, old good code contribution is recognized as help too).
